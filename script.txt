Welcome back to Print It Perfect.

It’s time I try something different. Today, I’m building the ultimate 3D printing tier list. Here’s the rules:

Only 3D printers from 2022 or newer and the newest of their class (Ender 3 V3 line)
These are my opinions. I’m not sponsored by any company, I’m currently a Bambu Lab user but I’ve worked with open source software.
Only printers that have at least 2 weeks of reviews are allowed (as of early June 2024)
I’m ranking within companies and then as one tier list.
I will consider the MSRP, not sales. If a company permanently lowers the MSRP, I’ll count that. I may mention if there are sales.
I’m only looking at consumer printers or consumer versions of printers (X1C rather than X1E)
All of these are amazing machines for different purposes.
So without a further adieu, let’s do it.

Channel Intro:

AnkerMake

S
A: M5C
B: M5
C: M5C
D
F

Starting with the Ankermake M5, this thing has some glowing qualities. Anker’s reputation and industrial practice makes the M5 very well built and honestly one of the better looking printers out there. It also greats the thing that every Bambu clone misses, ease of use. Since everyone ran to Klipper as an open source alternative, it adds a layer of complexity. Ankermake actually makes it pretty easy to use so that’s amazing. However, the M5 has a few issues. First, being built of aluminum makes it really expensive for what you get, you still get v rollers on a $700 printer. And look, the infection of AI. B tier 

*I fear no man but that thing… (compilation of AI on 3D printers) It scares me*
And the M5C, if they had added a touchscreen, this would be a pretty good printer but I feel removing all of the interfaces and just slapping on a button seems like cutting a massive corner. But the price is great so A tier.
   
And is that a camera?  What happened last time with an anker product with cameras? *Eufy incident* Doesn’t Anker have a “un”security company?? We’re all scared of Bambu but I think Anker has currently done worse. Not that they’ll do it again but leaves a sour taste.

Anycubic:

Just stick to resin printers. Your support strategy boils down to *drop it like it’s hot* But the Kobra 3 looks great… Have I seen that before… Just get an A1 but I guess only the Kobra 3 can get A tier, I comes down to if anycubic can actually support the Kobra 3

Bambu Lab:

S: P1S, A1, A1 mini 
A: X1C, 
B: P1P
C: AMS lite
D: AMS
F: 

Let’s start with the first Bambu Printer: The X1 Carbon. It’s a great machine and was revolutionary. The issue was that it’s just so overengineered. The AI and LIDAR are cool but seem pedantic with the additional cost. The touchscreen is nice but not worth the over $500 jump in price, especially when the rumored X2C or X2-XL is arriving soon. So it gets A tier.

Next, we have the P1P. The P1P cuts everything from the X1 and leaves the bare minimum. The issue is a few things on the P1P are half-baked. The screen is just terrible. The only other issue is the price. With the A1, the P1P is cornered into a really bad value. It’s too expensive from the A1 for just the CoreXY system and it’s too close to the P1S which adds an enclosure and many other nice to haves. If the P1P had a permanent price drop to $499 or even $549, this would be a direct competitor to the Sovol SV08 and other printers. B tier.
Then the P1S, this printer is a much better value. While looks aren’t everything, this, the X1C, and the A1 line look like appliances. The P1P looks like an experiment or a prototype, not something that looks finished. The P1S also adds glass which is a benefit. The P1S puts itself into “the advanced 3D printer”, making the X1C look overkill. S tier.

Now the A1 mini, The smallest printer and betraying Bambu's promise of “no more bed-slingers” However, I can’t believe I have to say this but size doesn’t matter. This thing proved that 3D printing is fun and truly showed the masses the magic of making things fast. It’s so easy and the price is nothing like it. Only $250 (not including the sale) is bonkers for this level of polish. I’m not even complaining about the material selection, it’s 250, What can you expect with this level of polish and sensors? It’s a bit too small for some projects but most average people won’t need that much space so for introducing many people to 3D printing it gets a S tier. 

Now onto the A1, everything great about the mini, now bigger. Adopting the larger size of their other printers, the A1 hits that sweet spot of being too limited and overkill. Yes, the heat bed incident left a sour taste but they handled it better than most companies would. Did you notice how almost no one stopped using them during the recall. And the price is fair enough for the larger screen and build size. So S tier, there’s a reason so many people recommend the A1 as the best printer under $400.  

Now, It’s time for the AMS. It’s a mess. They have some redeeming qualities like the dry box but it’s so over built, unreliable, hard to work into, and is pickier with filament than a child with veggies. This is the achilles heel of Bambu and it shows. And the waste… *Photos of massive amounts of waste* It’s something we have to face with single nozzle printers. And god does it take its time so D tier.

And the AMS Lite, It’s less over built and is more compatible but still has the curse of it’s bigger brother of time and waste. So slightly better but not by much so C tier.

Creality:

S: E3-V3, E3-V3+, K1C 
A: K1M 
B: K1, E3-V3KE, E3-V3SE
C: 
D: 
F: 

It’s time to look at Creality. Starting with the Ender 3 line, the SE and KE are interesting printers. These printers, with their terrible naming scheme, are not really that great. They follow the creality trend of adding one feature, adding a new name and keeping the price. Let’s start with the SE,the price is super approachable which is a plus, but it gets dramatically outpaced by something like the A1 mini in features and speed for only $90 more. But for the price, and featureset. It’s an amazing first option. If you really can’t spend more than $200 on a printer, the V3 SE is great. B tier because for a lil’ more you can do much better.

 Now, the KE, just a faster SE. The KE adds some improvements like faster speeds, larger touchscreen, linear rails, better cooling for $100 more. It’s not excellent, but it acts as a middle ground between the SE and the V3. Honestly, creality needs to learn the word “discontinue” because this ain’t it. B tier.

Now, I’m gonna rapid fire these. K1, rushed as hell and terrible app, but decent P1S competitor B tier. K1 Max, still rushed but larger = slightly better. A tier. K1C fixed what the K1 couldn’t so now it’s actually pretty good. S Tier. V3, terrible name, really solid A1 competitor. It’s a speed demon, pretty well built, good print quality. S tier. V3+, just bigger but bigger is better so S tier.  

Elegoo

S: N4Max
A: N4MaxN4+
B: N4+N4P
C: N4P OrangeStorm 
D: N4
F: 

So it’s time for Elegoo. First, why does Neptune 4 exist? Not the series but the base printer. The Neptune 4 is way too close to the pro. I had to dig for a comparison between the 2. Like elegoo, split the bed heaters into 2 and use linear rails. That’s fine but then they should either make the neptune 4 cheaper or get rid of it. So it gets a D tier. Now if the neptune 4 pro keeps its price. It’s an all-round great printer but the lack of wifi is a big turnoff for some people. And the neptune series has quite a few reliability issues so… The 4 plus is a decent mid range but also adds wifi 
 


Prusa

S: MK4
A: XL
B: 
C: Mini+
D: MK3S+
F: 

Okay, it’s Prusa time. First, why do you sell the Mark 3S+? No way I’m paying $900 bucks. To buy that new, you’d have to have the ultimate Prusa fan. I get why the Mark 4 cost so much but why the mk3s+? Just get rid of it already, D tier

Now, the Mini+. It’s cool but it’s an entry level printer at a mid tier price. With its PTFE hotend, bowden extruder, small bed size (for its prices). It’s not bad, but I expect more for the price even with the “european tax” . I'm not against open source and quality support. Glab prusa supports it but C tier.

Now the MK4, this is a great machine for relativity and consistency. It’s built like a tank and can actually move at a competitive pace. Sure the price is hefty but it comes with a touchscreen, direct drive, their nextruder system, and much more. For $799 for the kit. ** At the time of recording th Mk4 kit is on sale for $699 which is actually a really good price for what you get**  So, while being slow to innovate, it’s great so S tier. 

Now the XL, this is an iffy one. It’s such an innovative printer but it demands the price “my eyes spongebob meme” It had a problematic launch but the implications of the tool changer are insane. Too overkill and experimental for the average person but so innovative for the niche who will use it to it’s advantage so A tier.



Sovol
 
S: SV08, SV07+
A: SV07, SV06+
B: SV06
C: 
D:
F: 

The SV06, a budget favorite. Nothing wrong with it. I’d say it’s one of the best Prusa MK3 clones I’ve seen. It’s just that. A Prusa clone. There are other printers by Sovol that offer much more for a little more. If anything it did, it showed Prusa that a $600 upcharge on being “made in the EU” is insane. Not that buying from the EU is bad per say but not if it constitutes a X4 price increase. Again, there’s slightly better value out there so B tier.

The SV06+, the SV06 but bigger and better. The + takes the SVO6 from 220x220 to 300x300, improves the hot-end, and adds a touchscreen for $50 more. That’s crazy high value. The issue is that it’s getting slow and is now outpaced by printers like the E3 V3 and the A1 mini. A tier.  

The SV07, what I don’t like about the SV06, is now fixed. It’s fast. The touchscreen is big and is that… stock KlipperScreen! Almost every company tries to make what they think is the “best” interface and it just looks rushed, just use what’s already in front of you. Out of everything difficult about Klipper, Klipperscreen isn’t. The next issue is that not everyone can build with 220x220, and that’s where our next printer comes in. A tier.

**AD Over** 


The SV07+ is just a bigger SV07 and I’m not mad. Some people love that extra space. And the pricing and slightly extra space makes this a very well rounded machine for the cost (S tier).

Now, the SV08, a pretty good Voron clone. Not perfect but it’s a well built, open source, large format CoreXY and it cuts the right corners to make it half the price of comparable Voron kits. There isn’t much to say since it’s just a Voron with injection molded parts. This is the P1P killer and it’s not clickbait. I mean it’s massive, fast, open source, overall a really good printer if not the perfect printer. S Tier.
